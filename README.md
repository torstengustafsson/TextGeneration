# Text Generation using N-grams.

This started as a python script which I later decided to make a user interface for. It takes a large amount of text as input and generates completely new sentences from it.

The algorithm is based on N-grams and Markov chains. I followed the article below when I made it.

The application can download full texts from the Lord of The Rings trilogy, some of the Harry Potter books, and a couple of books from the Stormbringer series. These are texts that I happened to find on the internet, and they can easily be replaced with something else.
