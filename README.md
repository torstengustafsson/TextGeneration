# Text Generation using N-grams

This started as a python script which I later decided to make a user interface for. It takes a large amount of text as input and generates completely new sentences from it.

## Algorithm

The algorithm is based on N-grams and Markov chains. I followed the article below when I made it.

## Application

The application can download full texts from the Lord of The Rings trilogy, some of the Harry Potter books, and a couple of books from the Stormbringer series. These are texts that I happened to find on the internet, and they can easily be replaced with something else.

## Implementation

The project is implemented with Xamarin.Forms, in Visual Studio 2017 using a cross-platform solution. An Android and a Windows project is currently working. The iOS project is currently left untouched.
